He is best known and famous as author of several widely used academic and practitioner texts on Valuation, Corporate Finance and Investment Management.\\r\\n\\r\\nDamodaran is widely quoted on the subject of valuation, with 'a great reputation as a teacher and authority'. He has written several books on equity valuation, as well on corporate finance and investments.\\r\\n\\r\\nHe is also widely published in leading journals of finance, including The Journal of Financial and Quantitative Analysis, The Journal of Finance, The Journal of Financial Economics and the Review of Financial Studies. He is also known as being a resource on valuation and analysis to investment banks on Wall Street.\\r\\n\\r\\n## Current Datasets Available in API\\r\\n\\r\\n##### Total Beta By industry Sector\\r\\n\\r\\nThis dataset provides the [betas](http://www.investopedia.com/terms/b/beta.asp) by industry and region adjusted to reflect a firm's total exposure to risk rather than just the market risk component. It is a function of the market beta and the portion of the total risk that is market risk.\\r\\n\\r\\n***\\r\\n\\r\\n## Glossary\\r\\n\\r\\n> **Beta** is a measure of the volatility, or systematic risk, of a security or a portfolio in comparison to the market as a whole. Beta is used in the capital asset pricing model (CAPM), which calculates the expected return of an asset based on its beta and expected market returns. Beta is also known as the beta coefficient.\\r\\nhttp://www.investopedia.com/terms/b/beta.asp\\r\\n\\r\\n> **Unlevered Beta** compares the risk of an unlevered company to the risk of the market. The unlevered beta is the beta of a company without any debt. Unlevering a beta removes the financial effects from leverage. This number provides a measure of how much systematic risk a firm's equity has when compared to the market.\\r\\nhttp://www.investopedia.com/terms/u/unleveredbeta.asp\\r\\n\"\n\nconst introduction = \"# API: Industry Valuation Data\\r\\n\\r\\n[![CircleCI](https://circleci.com/gh/jdiejim/BYOB.svg?style=svg)](https://circleci.com/gh/jdiejim/BYOB)\\r\\n\\r\\nThis API provides annual updates of [Aswath Damodaran's](http://pages.stern.nyu.edu/~adamodar/) industry valuation data for US and global companies (both corporate finance and valuation metrics).\\r\\n\\r\\nThe API is [REST API](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Representational_State_Transfer 'RESTful')\\r\\nand uses [JWT](https://jwt.io/) for user authentication purposes.\\r\\nCurrently, return format for all endpoints is [JSON](http://json.org/ 'JSON').\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n      Data last updated: January 2017\\r\\n\\r\\n***\\r\\n\\r\\n## Versions\\r\\n\\r\\n#### V1: Includes the following data:\\r\\n * Total beta by industry sector and region\\r\\n * Industry names\\r\\n * Region names\\r\\n\\r\\n***\\r\\n\\r\\n## FAQ\\r\\n\\r\\n### What do I need to know before I start using the API?\\r\\n\\r\\nHere are the docs you might need to get started:\\r\\n\\r\\n- [REST API](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Representational_State_Transfer 'RESTful')\\r\\n- [JWT](https://jwt.io/)\\r\\n- [JSON](http://json.org)\\r\\n- [Betas](http://www.investopedia.com/terms/b/beta.asp)\\r\\n\\r\\n### How do I connect to the API?\\r\\n\\r\\nThe API is only available to clients with a consumer token.
