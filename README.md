## Datasets

##### Total Beta By industry Sector

This dataset provides the [betas](http://www.investopedia.com/terms/b/beta.asp) by industry and region adjusted to reflect a firm's total exposure to risk rather than just the market risk component. It is a function of the market beta and the portion of the total risk that is market risk.

## Glossary

> **Beta** is a measure of the volatility, or systematic risk, of a security or a portfolio in comparison to the market as a whole. Beta is used in the capital asset pricing model (CAPM), which calculates the expected return of an asset based on its beta and expected market returns. Beta is also known as the beta coefficient.
http://www.investopedia.com/terms/b/beta.asp

> **Unlevered Beta** compares the risk of an unlevered company to the risk of the market. The unlevered beta is the beta of a company without any debt. Unlevering a beta removes the financial effects from leverage. This number provides a measure of how much systematic risk a firm's equity has when compared to the market.

You can also programmatically access the [500px Directory](https://500px.com/directory). The Directory allows you to contact photographers and search for photographers by speciality, availability, service rates, language, camera, and other information. To gain access to the Directory API please contact sales@500px.com.

## FAQ
### What do I need to know before I start using the API?
Got rust on your skills? No worries. Here are the docs you might need to get started:

- HTTPS protocol
- [REST software pattern][]
- Authentication with [OAuth][] (or the official [Beginnerâ€™s Guide][])
- Data serialization with [JSON][] (or see a [quick tutorial][])

### How do I connect to the 500px.com API?
The API is only available to authenticated clients. Clients should authenticate users using [OAuth][]. Once authenticated, you need to request a resource from one of the endpoints using HTTPS. Generally, reading any data is done through a request with GET method. If you want our server to create, update or delete a given resource, POST or PUT methods are required.

### What return formats do you support?
500px API currently returns data in [JSON](http://json.org/ "JSON") format.

### What kind of authentication is required?
Applications must identify themselves to access any resource.
If your application only needs read-only access and does not authenticate the user, **consumer_key** containing a valid Consumer Key parameter should be specified in the query string. Otherwise, [OAuth](https://github.com/500px/api-documentation/tree/master/authentication) or upload key authentication takes care of identifying the application as well as the user accessing the API.

### Is there a request rate limit?
There is a rate limit of 1,000,000 API requests per month per account. We will contact you and, if required, disable your application if we find that your application is exceeding this limit or interfering with our system's stability. This revised rate limit came into effect May 1, 2014.
